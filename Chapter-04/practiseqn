1. What is []?
An empty list

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
spam=[2,4,6,8,10]
spam.insert(2,'hello)


For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
    'a'

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
    'd'
5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
    ['a','b']
For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
    1
7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
    increases length of the list
8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
    decreases legnth of the list
9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
    +,*
10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
    append can be used to insert value at the end of  a list only and only one value can be appended.while in insert we can add values between two elements.
11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
    del lst[] and lst.remove
12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.


13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
    lists are of square brackets and tuples are of simple brackets

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
    ('42',)

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
